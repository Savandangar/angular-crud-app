# Angular CRUD Application

This is a simple Angular CRUD application that allows users to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed **Node.js**.
- You have **npm** installed.

### Verify Node.js Installation

To verify if Node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is installed, this will print the version number. If not, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Verify npm Installation

To check if npm is installed, run the following command:

```bash
npm -v
```

If npm is installed, it will display the version number. If not, npm comes with Node.js, so you can install Node.js to get npm.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Savandangar/angular-crud-app.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd angular-crud-app
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

## Run the Application

After the installation, start the development server:
``` bash
npm start
```

The app will be live at:

http://localhost:4200/

You can now open your browser and view the application at the above URL.
